BigBasket Products Analysis

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing a dataset of BigBasket products. The dataset includes information about product categories, sub-categories,
sale prices, ratings, and other attributes. The goal is to perform various SQL queries to extract meaningful insights and perform complex
data manipulations. The results of these queries help in understanding product popularity, price trends, and other metrics.

## Dataset

The dataset is a CSV file named BigBasket Products.csv, which contains the following columns:

- index: number of rows or unique values.
- brand: The name of the brand.
- type: the type of the product.
- market_price: market price of the product.
- category: The main category of the product.
- sub_category: The sub-category of the product.
- product: The name of the product.
- sale_price: The sale price of the product.
- rating: The customer rating of the product.
   

## Usage

- *Intermediate Queries*: These queries provide basic insights such as average sale price per sub-category,
  total number of products per category, and number of products with ratings above a certain threshold.
- *Complex Queries*: These queries involve more advanced calculations, such as moving averages, percentage contributions,
  and identifying top-performing products.
- *Advanced Queries*: These queries involve sophisticated data manipulations, such as ranking products, calculating percentiles,
  and finding top products based on multiple criteria.
